For the app

>>if the laptop is connected to the wifi of the mobile 

From laptop run ipconfig to get the ip of the laptop

And port will see while running the server code

{ when i change the ip of the laptop to 192.168.1.1 and run the server  is at http://192.168.1.1:3000
 But when i open the app and click on face registration ,after filling the details it shows unable to connect
to the network and in the browser it shows unable to connect

Open the address in your mobile browser to test if running

>> Without changing the ipv4 address 
Keeping the address of the mobile from where the wifi is taken and also the app is  is installed 
in the same mobile

>> in browser whatever the address is showing add to the ip field of the mobile
